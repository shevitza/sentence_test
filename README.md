# sentence_test
Angular test with three part sentenses that can work without server.
We can describe with several sentences the most important things in every tutorial. If after every lesson we try to write few sentences on the topic, this would help us learn the lesson better.

The proposed test allows to construct sentences of three parts - left, middle and right part. This test can help for better understanding and learning of every lesson.

The test is helpfull for online learning eighter with video or only with texts. For every student it is important to find the correct answers in this test. For the teacher it is important to see the wrong answers and change his way of teaching so that students can learn better. The test is suitable for almost all topics, with the exception of those that require writing formulas or drawing.

This task is only "for students" and can work without server.

In this case we can generate the factory data files using node.js or by other ways. MS Excel and function Concatenate is useful variant for this task.
